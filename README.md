# PhytoDiscover: A Full-Stack Molecular Identification Platform

PhytoDiscover is a powerful, full-stack application designed for molecular identification using mass spectrometry data. It combines a sophisticated Python backend for scientific analysis with an interactive Next.js web interface, enabling researchers to rapidly identify compounds by comparing their spectral fingerprints against curated reference libraries.

## ðŸŒŸ Key Features

- **Multi-Domain Analysis**: Comes pre-loaded with modules for Clinical Diagnostics, Food Safety, and Forensic Toxicology.
- **Interactive Web UI**: A modern, user-friendly interface for selecting analysis modules, running searches, and viewing results.
- **Powerful Search Engine**: Utilizes the `matchms` library to perform robust spectral similarity searches.
- **Modular Architecture**: A clean and scalable project structure that separates core logic, web application, and command-line tools.
- **Extensible**: Easily add new analysis modules by creating new spectral libraries.

## ðŸš€ Getting Started

For detailed instructions on how to set up and run the different components of the application, please refer to the `README.md` files within the `webapp/` and `cli/` directories.

## Background and Inspiration

This project is inspired by the concepts presented in the DreaMS project, which demonstrated the power of learning molecular representations directly from mass spectrometry data. PhytoDiscover implements a similar core principle: every molecule has a unique spectral "fingerprint," and by comparing these fingerprints using algorithms like `ModifiedCosine`, we can rapidly identify unknown compounds in a sample.
